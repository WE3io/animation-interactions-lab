# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Use one of these channels:

1. GitHub Security Advisories (preferred): `Security` tab in this repository.
2. If advisory access is unavailable, open an issue titled `[SECURITY] Private report requested` without sensitive details; maintainers will move to a private channel.

## Response expectations

- Initial triage target: 3 business days
- Status updates during investigation
- Coordinated disclosure after fix availability
